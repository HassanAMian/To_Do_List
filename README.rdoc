== To Do List

This is a basic to do list without authentication.  It was my first rails app, so it doesn't have many features but it does have tests.

This app was written in Rails 4.  I was going to add authentication from scratch but I probably won't come back to it unless I don't have any other examples of authentication/authorization in later apps.

Gems used: Standard rails gems (very basic application, like I said).
